# UCGIS 2022 Symposium Workshop

## Practicing and Teaching Reproducibility and Replicability in the Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences

Reproductions and replications are needed in HEGS for the same reasons they are needed in other STEM fields: one-off studies are insufficient for developing generalizable theory.
Reproductions and replications by independent researchers provide the evidence necessary to evaluate the credibility and generalizability of theories across geographic contexts.
This workshop shares findings from the first year of a research project to advance the production of theory in the geographical sciences by (1) identifying barriers to the conduct of reproductions and replications in HEGS, (2) assessing the credibility of recent, highly-cited research findings, and (3) establishing a project-based educational model for reproduction and replication in HEGS.

The workshop integrates introductory technical training in our use of open science, git version control, and computational notebooks   is structured after an open science workflow for a reproduction study of a recent publication of COVID-19.
