# UCGIS 2022 Symposium Workshop

## Practicing and Teaching Reproducibility and Replicability in the Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences

Reproductions and replications (R&R) are needed in the human-environment and geographical sciences (HEGS) for the same reasons they are needed in other STEM fields.
Failures to independently reproduce the results of published studies undermine credibility and ability to inform public policy, while acceptance of generalizable theory requires verification of theorized relationships across multiple independent studies.
The goal of reproducing a published study is to verify its findings and validity by repeating the study with identical data and methods.
The goal of replicating a study is to test its reliability and generalizability by collecting new data while repeating the same methods.
Reproductions and replications by independent researchers provide the evidence necessary to evaluate the credibility of findings and generalizability of theories across geographic contexts.
Despite a flurry of recent publications on the topic of reproducibility in HEGS, most research publications are not reproducible and there is no precedent for publishing reproduction or replication studies.

In this workshop, we share experience and findings from the first year of a research project to advance the production of theory in the geographical sciences by (1) identifying barriers to R&R in HEGS, (2) assessing the credibility of recent impactful studies, and (3) establishing a project-based educational model for R&R in HEGS. Thus far, we have (1) developed a framework for reproducible research practices in HEGS, (2) trained undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in GIScience courses in reproducible research practices, and (3) reproduced or replicated seven published studies with teams of undergraduate and graduate students.

The workshop integrates discussions about integrating R&R in HEGS research and teaching with introductory technical training in our pedagogical approach and our use of version control, metadata, open source GIS, computational notebooks, and research compendia as tools for reproducible research and teaching.

## Schedule

### Prior to Workshop

- 10 mins: Pre-survey
- 20 mins: Read Chakraborty, J. 2021. Social inequities in the distribution of COVID-19: An intra-categorical analysis of people with disabilities in the U.S. Disability and Health Journal 14 (1):101007. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007. (chose this because it's so short, and can still illustrate so many of our findings. Just five pages including references)

### First Hour

  - Powerpoint presentation of key concepts and overview of our project and the workflow / set of techniques we are using for reproducibility
- 5 mins: Discussion
- 25 mins: Pre-analysis plan the reproduction study
  - 5 min demo: OSF projects & registrations
  - 15 min guided analysis: Workflow diagram and Pre-analysis plan (with mostly completed handouts)
  - 5 min demo: Metadata with USGS Metadata Wizard
- 5 mins: Discussion

### Second Hour

- 10 mins: Break

  - Demo: add files to private folders & commit them
  - Illustrate & discuss usage in research collaboration (issues, data management plans, intellectual contributions, version tracking)
  - Illustrate & discuss usage in teaching (lab development & deployment, collaborative work, student self-publishing)
- 10 mins: Discussion

### Third Hour

- 10 mins: Break
- 30 mins: Computational notebooks: Illustration with RMarkdown
  - work through execution of Chakraborty notebook as an example
  - highlight differences from the original publication, e.g. new figures, different statistics
- 10 mins: Results and Discussion
  - was the reproduction successful?
  - what have you learned from the reproduction study?
  - what is a Reanalysis
- 10 mins: Post-survey
