**Headline** Transforming HEGS research by establishing a framework of research procedures and pedagogy for conducting reproductions and replications

## About
Reproductions and replications are needed in HEGS for the same reasons they are needed in other STEM fields: one-off studies are insufficient for developing generalizable theory. Reproductions and replications by independent researchers provide the evidence necessary to evaluate the credibility and generalizability of theories across geographic contexts. This project will advance the production of theory in the geographical sciences by (1) identifying barriers to the conduct of reproductions and replications in HEGS, (2) assessing the credibility of recent, highly-cited research findings and (3) establishing a project-based educational model for reproduction and replication in HEGS.
