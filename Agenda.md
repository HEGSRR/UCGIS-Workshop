# Agenda

Practicing and Teaching Reproducibility and Replicability in the Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences

## Prior to Workshop

- 10 mins: Pre-survey
- 20 mins: Read Chakraborty, J. 2021. Social inequities in the distribution of COVID-19: An intra-categorical analysis of people with disabilities in the U.S. Disability and Health Journal 14 (1):101007. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007. (chose this because it's so short, and can still illustrate so many of our findings. Just five pages including references)

## First Hour

- 10 mins: Introductions (facilitators & participants)
- 15 mins: Reproducibility & Replicability in Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences
  - Powerpoint presentation of key concepts and overview of our project and the workflow / set of techniques we are using for reproducibility
- 5 mins: Discussion
- 25 mins: Pre-analysis plan the reproduction study
  - 5 min demo: OSF projects & registrations
  - 15 min guided analysis: Workflow diagram and Pre-analysis plan (with mostly completed handouts)
  - 5 min demo: Metadata with USGS Metadata Wizard
- 5 mins: Discussion

## Second Hour

- 10 mins: Break
- 40 mins: Git and GitHub for Education and Research Collaboration
  - HEGSRR template research compendium
  - version control concepts (fork & clone `RPr-Chakraborty` repository)
  - Atom text editor
  - Markdown (edit main Readme)
  - Push changes to GitHub
  - .gitignore
  - privacy and large files
  - Demo: add files to private folders & commit them
  - Illustrate & discuss usage in research collaboration (issues, data management plans, intellectual contributions, version tracking)
  - Illustrate & discuss usage in teaching (lab development & deployment, collaborative work, student self-publishing)
- 10 mins: Discussion

## Third Hour

- 10 mins: Break
- 30 mins: Computational notebooks: Illustration with RMarkdown
  - work through execution of Chakraborty notebook as an example
  - highlight differences from the original publication, e.g. new figures, different statistics
- 10 mins: Results and Discussion
  - was the reproduction successful?
  - what have you learned from the reproduction study?
  - what is a Reanalysis
- 10 mins: Post-survey
