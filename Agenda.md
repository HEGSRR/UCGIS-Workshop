## Introduction

- 10 mins Introductions:
  - Peter Kedron
  - Joe Holler
  - Emily Zhou
  - HEGSRR NSF Project (GitHub, OSF)
  - Repository for this workshop
  - GSI Covid Fellows @ University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
  - Agenda
  - Participant Introductions (Name, Pronoun, University)
- 20 mins: Presentation: Reproducibility & Replicability in Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences
  - Validity, public trust
  - Reproducibility
  - Replicability
  - Reanalysis
  - Open Science
  - Open Source GIS toolkit: Git, Atom, R, Python, SQL  
  - Annals Special Issue contributions
  - Konkol, Nust et al. computational reproducibility
  - Our major findings & outputs so far
  - Phases of doing a reproduction study (with students)
    - Close reading of methodology
    - Workflow plan
    - Pre-analysis plan
    - Metadata research and documentation
    - Implementation in R or Python
    - Report -- to GitHub Pages
- 5 mins: Discussion
  - Have you used reproductions in your own research?
  - Have you incorporated reproductions in your teaching or training?
  - Barriers / Concerns?
  - Benefits / Motivations?

## Git & GitHub for R&R Scholarship

- Break: did you have a chance to sign up for GitHub and install GitHub and Atom?

- 40 mins: Git and GitHub for Education and Research Collaboration
  - GitHub for Education resources
  - Each repository is an assignment; GitHub pages
  - Research project compendium --> publication --> student reproduction assignment --> reanalysis / replication --> new study
  - HEGSRR template research compendium
  - version control concepts (fork & clone `RPr-Chakraborty` repository)
  - Atom text editor
  - Markdown (edit main Readme)
  - Push changes to GitHub
  - .gitignore
  - privacy and large files
  - Demo: add files to private folders & commit them
  - Illustrate & discuss usage in research collaboration (issues, data management plans, intellectual contributions, version tracking)
  - Illustrate & discuss usage in teaching (lab development & deployment, collaborative work, student self-publishing)

### Discussion

- Do you perceive any barriers or have any misgivings about using GitHub and GitHub pages for your research? For your teaching?
- Can you imagine any specific ways in which you could adopt version control,
- Do you have any suggestions for our `HEGSRR-Template`?
- Let's have a conversation about credit and incentives.

## Preparing a (reproduction) study

- Break: did you have a chance to read the paper?

- 25 mins: Pre-analysis plan the reproduction study
  - 5 min activity introduction
    - highlighting paper
    - focusing on inputs, outputs and processes
    - workflow diagram
    - pre-analysis plan
  - 20 min guided analysis: Workflow diagram and Pre-analysis plan (with mostly completed handouts)
- 5 mins: Discussion / Break
  - During Break, help install software

## RStudio and Computational Notebooks: The RPr-Chakraborty-2021 Study

- Break: did you have a chance to install R and RStudio? Do you have a Census API?
- 30 mins: Computational notebooks: Illustration with RMarkdown
  - work through execution of Chakraborty notebook as an example
  - highlight differences from the original publication, e.g. new figures, different statistics

### Discussion

- Would you consider the reproduction to be an exact success, an approximate success, or a failure?
- Have you learned anything about the original study that *you would not have known* without attempting a reproduction study?
- Given what we have found, do you have any ideas for developing a new study in the form of a *reanalysis*, a *replication*, or an *extension*?
- Let's return to the question of incentives and evaluation in the context of teaching. Do you have any ideas for assignments to give to students, for the honor code in terms of collaboration or use of others' materials, and for assessment of learning and assigning of grades?
