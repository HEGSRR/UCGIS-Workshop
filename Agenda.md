## Part I: Overview of R&R in HEGS

### Vignette: Spatial Accessibility in Illinois
- Reproduce studies with Jupyter Notebook on CyberGISX
- Reproduction and Replication studies by Derrick Burt
- Reanalysis by Kufre Udoh
- Reprodution study with the Spring 2021 class and Summer 2021 research assistants

### Reproducibility and Replicability in the Geographical Sciences
- Sciences
  - Science under COVID-19
  - How do we trust science?
- Spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity
- Reproduction for credibility and scientific progress
- Literature highlights
- Highlights of R&R in geography

### Practical Computational Reproducibility
- Conditions for reproducibility
- Improving R&R
- Infrastructure

### R&R Pedagogy
- Project-based learning
- Rethinking the learning goals
- Open Source GIScience curriculum
- Vision for R&R in geography

**Discussion session I**
- What are our individual and collective motivations for trying reproduction studies?
- Any failures, concerns, and misgiving?

## Part II: Research Compendium in Git & GitHub

### GitHub Overview
- Challenges
- Git & GitHub version control
- GitHub features
- Tips, Tricks & Limitation

### Template for R&R Research in HEGS
- Executable research compendium
- Repository template for HEGS research
- Use .gitignore and code to manage data

### Managing GitHub Repositories


**Discussion session II**
- Are there any specific ways you want to integrate Git version control into your scholarship?
- Are there specific reasons that you wish you had already adopted Git in the past?
- Any concerns or misgivings?



## Part III: Plan and Register a Reproduction / Replication Study

### Pre-analysis Plan Overview
- Reproduction study worked example
- Pre-analysis planning & registration
- OSF pre-analysis plan registration
- R&R pre-analysis plan
- Workflow diagram
- Activity

### The Spatial Scan Statistics
- SaTScan
  - SaTScan input
  - SaTScan analysis
  - SaTScan advanced options
- Generalized Estimating Equations

**Discussion session III**
- Have we already learned more from researching its data sources and planning a workflow? What?
- Do you notice any errors or missing information? If you were peer reviewing this study or planning to reproduce it, what more would you want to know?
- Have you developed any concerns about the study?

**Discussion session IV**
- Does the “spatial is special” phrase apply to pre-analysis plan registration?
- Are there ways in which spatial data and spatial analysis require additional attention to detail and scrutiny if pre-analysis planning is to support enhanced replicability?


## Part IV: Execute a Computational Notebook in RStudio

### RStudio and R Markdown Overview
- GUI for R
- R Markdown computational notebook
- Reading R
- R Markdown practices

### Execute R Markdown Computational Notebooks

### Reproduction Study Result
- Comparing GEE results
- Reproduction report

**Discussion session V**
- Was this reproduction an exact success? Approximate success? Failure?
- Why?

**Discussion session VI**
- Have we learned anything about Chakraborty’s study that we did not know based on the paper? What?
- Can you imagine ways in which the reproduction study could be replicated, reanalyzed, or extended?

**Discussion session VII**
- Are there specific ways you can imagine benefitting from R&R practices into your ongoing and future scholarly activity?
- Are there specific barriers to adopting R&R practices into your ongoing and future scholarly activity?

**Discussion session VII**
- If we can work out R&R in geography, can you envision ways in which geography could contribute to other sciences or to convergent / interdisciplinary research?
- Interest in trying a reproduction or replication project in a course you are teaching?
