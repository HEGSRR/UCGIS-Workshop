## Welcome Email

Dear Workshop Participants,

We are looking forward to meeting with you on Monday afternoon!

In order to maximize our time together, please bring a laptop to the workshop and prepare the following free online accounts and software.

- [ ] Sign up for a [Census API Key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html). Please save this code for accessing U.S. Census and American Community Survey data with computer scripts.
- [ ] Sign up for a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
  - We suggest using an academic email account for GitHub to facilitate access to [GitHub Education resources and benefits](https://education.github.com/teachers)
- [ ] Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), a free application to facilitate downloading and updating Git repositories on your local computer.
- [ ] Install the latest version of [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/), an open source computer language for scientific computation. As of June 4, 2022, this is version `4.2.0`.
- [ ] Install the latest (free) version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), free software to facilitate using R in a friendly graphical user interface.

- [ ] Install [Atom](https://atom.io/), a text editor with GitHub integration and support for most coding languages
-	In the workshop, we will work through a reproduction study of a short paper. We suggest reading the paper once beforehand. We selected this paper for the workshop in part because it is just 4 pages (excluding references) and a 20-30 minute read. The paper is:
  - Social inequities in the distribution of COVID-19: An intra-categorical analysis of people with disabilities in the U.S. Disability and Health Journal 14 (1):101007. DOI:[doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007)
- We have made a version of the paper highlighting content relevant to reproducing available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17MkKLY6c-EYmQ0fB-aIaVb80CjNRIS2Q/view?usp=sharing) This file is meant to be shared only with workshop participants for educational purposes.

Each of the software programs listed above should be straightforward to install on either Windows or MacOS. However, if you have any difficulties, we will be available via email or during breaks in the workshop to assist with the installations.

Safe travels to Syracuse,
Joseph Holler
